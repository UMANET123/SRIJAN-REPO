## Implementation Details
A Secret is generated by calling 

```javascript
const secret = optlib.authenticator.generateSecret();
```

And to generate an OTP, we append the `address` with the `secret`, to verify also, we append the `address` with the `secret`

The OTP is short lived, only for `30s` ( seconds )
